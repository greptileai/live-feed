onyx-dot-app/onyx,https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/pull/6706,6706,refactor: Clean up message display,raunakab,2025-12-12 17:16:21,open,new_commits,2/5,logic,"The comment identifies a boolean operator precedence bug in error banner display logic that would prevent error messages from rendering correctly to users. This is a meaningful logic error that affects user experience by hiding important error information, though the specific code isn't shown in the diff to verify the claim.",2025-12-15 18:48:31
simstudioai/sim,https://github.com/simstudioai/sim/pull/2389,2389,fix(vm): use node child process for RCE,waleedlatif1,2025-12-15 16:41:16,closed,new_pr,2/5,runtime,"Greptile identified a critical production deployment bug where the worker file path resolves incorrectly in Docker/standalone Next.js builds, causing `import.meta.url` to point to non-existent source locations instead of the built files. This would completely break the code execution functionality in production since the child process cannot spawn with an invalid file path.",2025-12-15 18:48:31
nvidia-nemo/curator,https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Curator/pull/1307,1307,feat: Add dependabot workflow for periodic lock file updates v2,pablo-garay,2025-12-15 14:15:58,open,new_commits,3/5,logic,"The workflow declares an output `has-changes` that references a step id `check-changes` which doesn't exist in the workflow. This will cause the output to be empty/undefined, breaking any downstream jobs that depend on this value to determine whether to proceed with creating a PR or other actions.",2025-12-15 18:48:31
ever-works/ever-works-website-template,https://github.com/ever-works/ever-works-website-template/pull/408,408,"Revert ""feat: add trial amount configuration for Polar checkout""",Innocent-Akim,2025-12-15 16:28:34,closed,new_pr,1/5,logic,The comment identifies that this revert accidentally removes critical bug fixes including JSON parse error handling (causing 500 instead of 400 errors) and AbortError handling logic that distinguishes timeouts from cancellations. These are real logic errors that will cause production issues with incorrect error responses and improper timeout handling.,2025-12-15 18:48:31
veda-labs/boring-vault,https://github.com/Veda-Labs/boring-vault/pull/560,560,Pass array of assets for USR resolv leafs,Zokunei,2025-12-15 15:25:45,open,new_commits,0/5,runtime,"Greptile caught a breaking API change where a new required `assets` parameter was added to a function signature without updating 7+ call sites, causing compilation failures. Additionally, it identified unsafe `symbol()` calls on ERC20 tokens that will cause runtime reverts for non-standard tokens that don't implement this optional function.",2025-12-15 18:48:31
