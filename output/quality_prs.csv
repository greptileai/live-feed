nvidia/fuser,https://github.com/NVIDIA/Fuser/pull/5670,5670,Auto scheduler for TMA inner reduction,tbqh,2025-12-12 02:23:41,open,new_commits,4/5,logic,"Greptile identified a commented-out architecture check that would incorrectly enable TMA on unsupported GPU architectures, potentially causing crashes or incorrect behavior.",2025-12-18 14:16:39
opentech1/openchat,https://github.com/opentech1/openchat/pull/469,469,feat: migrate authentication from WorkOS to Better Auth with GitHub OAuth,leoisadev8,2025-12-18 12:42:26,closed,new_pr,2/5,"logic, security","Greptile identified three critical security and authentication bugs in this WorkOS to Better Auth migration: (1) sign-out fails silently due to deleting cookies with incorrect names, leaving users authenticated when they think they've logged out, (2) missing Secure flags on session cookies make them vulnerable to interception over HTTP, and (3) the migration logic enables account takeover by linking accounts based solely on email matching without proper verification.",2025-12-18 14:16:03
ever-co/ever-gauzy,https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy/pull/9271,9271,Stage,evereq,2025-12-18 13:43:35,closed,new_pr,3/5,"data_integrity, logic","Greptile identified two medium-severity bugs: an authentication logic issue where users get stuck in an unauthenticated state with no recovery path when auth fails, and a data integrity bug where cached status progress values could leak between tenants, potentially causing tasks to be updated with incorrect status IDs from other organizations.",2025-12-18 14:16:03
stack-auth/stack-auth,https://github.com/stack-auth/stack-auth/pull/1073,1073,[Changelog] New changelog app,madster456,2025-12-18 13:06:42,open,new_pr,2/5,runtime,Greptile caught a critical configuration incompatibility where the changelog app is set up for static export but includes an API route that will fail at runtime since Next.js static exports don't support API routes.,2025-12-18 14:16:53
browseros-ai/browseros-server,https://github.com/browseros-ai/BrowserOS-server/pull/105,105,"feat: rate limiter improvement (fetch daily limit, show error with google form link)",felarof99,2025-12-18 13:48:41,closed,new_pr,2/5,"runtime, data_integrity","Greptile identified a database migration bug where a column was removed from the schema definition without properly migrating existing SQLite databases. This would cause INSERT statement failures in production since existing tables still expect the old 4-column structure while the new code only provides 3 values, breaking existing installations.",2025-12-18 14:16:03
emerge-lab/pufferdrive,https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/PufferDrive/pull/192,192,collision fix,l1onh3art88,2025-12-18 14:00:11,closed,new_pr,1/5,logic,"Greptile caught a significant logic bug where squared distance is compared to a linear distance threshold, causing the max segment length constraint to be approximately 22x smaller than intended, which would break the collision detection fix.",2025-12-18 14:16:59
onyx-dot-app/onyx,https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/pull/6864,6864,feat: deep research continued,yuhongsun96,2025-12-18 15:49:49,closed,new_pr,1/5,logic,"Greptile caught two critical logic bugs: an infinite loop caused by incrementing the wrong counter variable (`llm_cycle_count` instead of `cycle_count`), and a data loss issue where collected documents are discarded by returning a hardcoded empty list instead of the gathered results. Both bugs would cause the research feature to malfunction completely.",2025-12-18 16:22:27
onyx-dot-app/onyx,https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/pull/6854,6854,feat: deep research more dev stuff,yuhongsun96,2025-12-18 14:07:47,closed,new_pr,2/5,runtime,Greptile caught a runtime bug where function calls weren't updated after the function signature was modified to require two new parameters (`is_reasoning_model` and `user_identity`). This mismatch between the function definition and its call sites would cause TypeError exceptions when the code executes.,2025-12-18 16:22:27
helicone/helicone,https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/pull/5436,5436,remove old models,chitalian,2025-12-18 14:56:56,closed,new_pr,2/5,logic,Greptile caught an incomplete refactoring where model definitions were removed from the codebase but references to those models still remained in other files. This would cause runtime failures when the application tries to look up the deleted model IDs.,2025-12-18 16:22:27
helicone/helicone,https://github.com/Helicone/helicone/pull/5434,5434,fix click jacking,chitalian,2025-12-18 14:03:56,open,new_pr,2/5,runtime,Greptile correctly identified that importing DOMPurify directly (instead of isomorphic-dompurify) in Next.js components will cause runtime crashes during server-side rendering because DOMPurify requires the DOM/window object which doesn't exist on the server.,2025-12-18 16:23:08
