The || operator has lower precedence than the ternary operator, so the expression is indeed parsed as (toastProps.autoClose || myProps?.type === ""error"") ? 8000 : 5000, meaning any truthy autoClose value would be ignored. This is a non-obvious bug that many developers would miss, and Greptile's analysis is correct with a clear fix.",2026-01-12 18:53:19
