**logic:** If any hash is `undefined`, it will become string `""undefined""` in the joined result, potentially causing incorrect shared static IDs

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

In JavaScript, `undefined.toString()` in array join becomes the string 'undefined', which would create incorrect shared static IDs if any update lacks a hash. This is a non-obvious bug that could cause different static content groups to get the same or incorrect IDs, and the suggested fix with a type guard filter is correct and actionable.",2026-01-21T02:59:01.660659+00:00
