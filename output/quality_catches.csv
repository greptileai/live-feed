**logic:** Calling `close()` twice will throw due to the ""closed"" → any transition being invalid. Make this method idempotent by checking current state first.

```suggestion
  public close(): void {
    if (this._state.lifecycle === ""closed"" || this._state.lifecycle === ""closing"") {
      return;
    }
    this.transition(""closing"");

**logic:** Traffic spike warning route is missing severity matcher unlike the critical route - this will catch all traffic_spike alerts regardless of severity. Should this warning route only match alerts without a severity label, or should it include a severity matcher for consistency?

How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.
